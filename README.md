# Hand-Waving Detection with PyTorch

## Overview

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to detect hand-waving gestures in images. The dataset consists of images labeled with hand-waving and non-hand-waving classes. The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Dataset


### 2. Train the Model



### 3. Evaluate the Model


### 4. Customize

Feel free to customize the code, model architecture, and hyperparameters based on your specific requirements.
